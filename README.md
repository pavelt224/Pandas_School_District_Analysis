# Pandas_School_District_Analysis


### Module 4 Challenge
The following is a summary of the school district analysis:
The goal of the school district analysis is to find proof that Thomas High School ninth graders' reading and math grades were altered. The school board wanted to know the extent of the deception, so they requested that any evidence be found. They request that the freshman reading and math scores be replaced with NaNs entries, and that the rest of the data be analyzed by repeating the school district analysis from the PyCitySchools.ipynb Module 4 project.

The following questions will be addressed in the corresponding charts and descriptions for each bulleted list.

• What impact does the district summary have?

Summary Charts for School Districts
When the 9th grade student Math and Reading results from Thomas High Schools were omitted from the District Summary, the disparity between the two charts above the average can be seen. With the exception of Thomas High School 9th grade students, average scores in Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, percent Passing Math, percent Passing Reading, and percent Overall Passing were slightly affected by tenths of an average score in Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, percent Passing Math, percent Passing Reading, and percent Overall Passing. The minor fall in averages does not change the overall picture, but it will have an impact on the summaries that follow.

• What impact does the school summary have?

With or without Thomas High School, school summaries
When the Thomas High School 9th grade students' Reading and Math scores are excluded from the charts above, the change is minor. The Thomas High School scores without the 9th have a little fall in percent Overall Passing, for example, from 90.948012 to 90.630324. When comparing Thomas High School percent Overall Passing placement, there isn't much of a difference. They are still passing in the 90th percentile.

• How does substituting the math and reading scores of ninth graders effect Thomas High School's performance in comparison to the other schools?

Replacing ninth graders' math and reading scores has no effect on Thomas High School's percent Overall Passing rating in comparison to other schools. They're still on the verge of passing the 90th percentile. 

• What impact does replacing ninth-grade grades have on the following:

Grade-level math and reading scores
With the ninth graders' math and reading scores removed, Thomas High School's math and reading scores only alter significantly, and Thomas High School remains in the district's Top Five Schools.

Scores based on how much money the school spends
Thomas High School's spending per student increased from $638.00 to $888.53 after excluding the ninth graders' math and reading scores.
Scores for schools of various sizes
By eliminating the ninth graders' math and reading scores from Thomas High School, the scores by school size are also marginally influenced.
Scores for different types of schools
Excluding the ninth graders' math and reading scores from Thomas High School has a minor impact on the scores by school type size.

After the reading and math results for the ninth grade at Thomas High School were substituted with NaNs. The four changes are reflected in the Average Math & Reading scores, % Passing Math and Reading scores, Overall Passing marks and the funding for each student. The average grades were slightly influenced, but we can observe the difference in financing for each kid, which is almost $200. The top school, Thomas High School, does not change at all.
